# Pulling Carmaker Mentions from Twitter
***

## Abstract
This is a small project on how to pull specific words from Twitter users using `Python`. In this specific instance, I will pick out car brands from tweets and store them in a CSV file. I also picked out the time the user tweeted for future Time Series Analysis.
